Introduction
===================================

We focused on ease of usage and simplicity when developping our game
engine. You won\'t be able to develop complex games but you will be able
to develop simple games with fast and easily. We provided you with all
th e documentation you needenjoy. Feedback and optimizations are
appreciated.

Composition
====================================

Our engine is composed with several classes, namespaces, enums,
structures and templates. These are listed below

Namespaces
